It is using a self hosted [umami.is](https://cloud.umami.is/) instance for analytics. This is a fork from [academicpages.github.io](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), which I first discovered via [Jean-Rémi King](https://kingjr.github.io/).

I made [quite a few contributions and tried my best to upstream the changes](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues?q=thiswillbeyourgithub).
