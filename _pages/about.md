I'm Olivier Cornelis, a French psychiatry resident and a self-taught developer / data scientist.

This page is an informal introduction to me and what I'm up to. A more formal introduction can be found in [CV](./cv_en).

## Education

I took advanced math/physics/chemistry classes in [classe prÃ©pa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles), then went to [medical school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Cit%C3%A9_University) during which I did a 2 months master research internship (french: "stage de M1") at [NeuroSpin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeuroSpin) creating from scratch a cluster plotting and benchmarking library for neuroscience. In 2025 I started [medical residency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education_in_France#Third_cycle_of_the_medical_studies) in psychiatry in Paris, France.

I started coding when I was about 12. I'm passionate about open source - most of my code is publicly available on [my github](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/). Here are my stats:

I have experience working in collaboration and autonomously: I had the opportunity to build innovative solutions from scratch and make them freely available. Examples of my self-motivation include:
- To search across my diverse medical corpus dataset with natural language query I created [wdoc](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/wdoc/). The innovative summarizer feature was added to save me time catching up on the news.
- Tinkering with [high dimensional embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding_(machine_learning)) led me to create [QuestEA](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/QuestEA) and pitch it to renowned researchers. The goal being to uncover hidden patterns in medical questionnaires allowing to unify partially disjointed medical datasets.
- Tinkering with [AI interpretability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) led me to fork the [repeng](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/repeng-research-fork) library to test various high dimensional vector modification techniques to steer its behavior.

## Interests
My core interest has always been around neuroscience with a focus on psychiatry.

Circa 2015, I got interested in AI/ML so naturally I'm heavily drawn towards computational psychiatry.

I'm excited about how AI research will advance psychiatry research, improving patient's lives for the better.

At the same time, clinical observations from psychiatry could inform more robust and interpretable AI systems that better serve human needs.

## Things I love
- Medicine, obviously.
- [Open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_and_closed-source_software) software/hardware ([even this website](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/website])).
- When building blocks I participated in have positive compounding effects.
- Applying the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).
- Repairing stuff.
- [Robust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility), [distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing) systems.

                <li>I have a deep fascination for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization">self-organization</a></li>
                <li>The former essential, I think, to understand counsciousness. And the latter is very connected to my interest in distributed and decentralized systems (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">AT Protocol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/">Reticulum</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-iroh/">PRIME-IROH</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mudler/edgevpn">edgevpn</a>, <a href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">Conflict-Free-Replicated-Data-Type</a>, ...).</li>
                <li>In my view, both are deeply linked to neuroscience and will be useful to help patients.</li>
