I'm Olivier Cornelis, a French psychiatry resident in Paris. I'm also a (mostly self-taught) developer and data scientist.

## Education

I started coding on my own, then [bac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at) with honors, then some math/physics/chemistry in [classe prÃ©pa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles) (`A` grade), then [medical school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Cit%C3%A9_University) with a Master-1-type internship at [NeuroSpin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeuroSpin), then [medical residency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education_in_France#Third_cycle_of_the_medical_studies) in [psychiatry](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrie_en_France).

Almost everything I code is open source and hosted on [my github](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/). Here are my stats:

I have worked in collaboration but can work autonomously : my coding experience forced me to create solutions from scratch. For example:
- getting frustrated with keeping track of knowledge source in med school made me create [wdoc](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/wdoc/)
- having a new idea on using machine learning for psychiatry let me to create [QuestEA](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/QuestEA)
- pretty much all my other projects listed in the [Projects](./projects) page.


## Interests
My core interest has always been around neuroscience with a focus on psychiatry.

Circa 2015, I got interested in AI/ML so naturally I'm heavily drawn towards computational psychiatry.

I'm highly convinced that AI research will advance psychiatry research, improving patient's lives for the better.

At the same time, clinical observations from psychiatry could inform more robust and interpretable AI systems that better serve human needs.

## Personality


Things I love:
- [love open source and hate closed source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_and_closed-source_software) software/hardware.
- encryption-by-default and privacy respecting tech.
- applying the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).
- repairing stuff.
- robust, distributed and resilient systems.
- Coding things from scratch.

Things I hate:
- Forcing others to reinvent the wheel.
- Having to invent a wheel knowing full well that someone already did it in the past but did not open source it.
