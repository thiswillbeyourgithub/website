I'm Olivier Cornelis. A French medical resident in psychiatry in Paris. I'm also a (mostly self-taught) developer and datascientist.

## Education

I started coding on my own, then [bac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at), then some math/physics/chemistry in [classe prÃ©pa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles), then [medical school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Cit%C3%A9_University) with a Master-1-type internship at [NeuroSpin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeuroSpin), then [medical residency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education_in_France#Third_cycle_of_the_medical_studies) in [psychiatry](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrie_en_France).

Almost everything I code is open source and hosted on [my github](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/). Here are my stats:

## Interests
My core interests is neuroscience with a focus on psychiatry. Around 2015 I got interested in AI/ML so naturally I'm drawn towards computational psychiatry.

I'm highly convinced that AI research will advance psychiatry research, improving patient's lives for the better.

At the same time, clinical observations from psychiatry could inform more robust and interpretable AI systems that better serve human needs.

## Personality
I love:
- [love open source and hate closed source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_and_closed-source_software) software/hardware.
- encryption-by-default and privacy respecting tech.
- applying the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).
- repairing stuff.
- robust, distributed and resilient systems.
- Coding things from scratch.

I hate:
- Forcing others to reinvent the wheel.
- Having to invent a wheel knowing full well that someone already did it in the passed but did not open source it.

I have worked in collaboration but can work autonomously : my coding experience forced me to create solutions from scratch.

Examples of this are:
- getting frustrated with keeping track of knowledge source in med school made me create [wdoc](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/wdoc/)
- having a new idea on using machine learning for psychiatry let me to create [QuestEA](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/QuestEA)
- pretty much all my other projects listed in the [Projects](./projects) page.



### Misc

#### Bounty Track Record

Being dedicated to open source, I try to fund what I can using bounty incentives.

1. [Porting my SleepTk app from a micropython-based OS to a C-based device](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/SleepTk_pinetime_sleep_tracker/issues/13)
2. [Adding highlights on the mobile webapp for Karakeep](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep/issues/1220)

3. *The other bounties are currently in progress*
