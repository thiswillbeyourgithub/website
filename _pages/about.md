I'm Olivier Cornelis. A medical resident in psychiatry in Paris. I'm also a (mostly self-taught) developer and datascientist.

[![Olivier Cornelis's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=thiswillbeyourgithub&show_icons=true&theme=transparent)](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/github-readme-stats)

**Education**: started coding on my own, then [bac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at), then some math/physics/chemistry in [classe prÃ©pa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles), then [medical school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Cit%C3%A9_University) with a Master-1-type internship at [NeuroSpin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeuroSpin), then [medical residency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education_in_France#Third_cycle_of_the_medical_studies) in [psychiatry](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrie_en_France). I never managed to quit coding so here we are ðŸ¤·. If you want to know more about me, my email and [Bluesky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesky) handle can be found in this README.

**Interests**: everything AI & NeuroscienceðŸ§ , including in-betweens and even-remotely-related. This obviously includes psychiatry and computational psychiatry.

**Belief:** As of 2025, I believe that bridging "deep learning" and neuroscience represents a very promising avenue for advancing patient care. The computational insights from AI could enhance our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying mental health conditions, while clinical observations from psychiatry could inform more robust and interpretable AI systems that better serve human needs.

**Personality**: investing my time by coding from the grounds up, hate closed source systems and forcing others to reinvent the same stack, love collaboration, love distributed and resilient systems, love deep learning interpretability, love repairing stuff.

**Strength**: Although I think I'm good at working with teams as I'm used to collaborating with open source projects at various scale, I also think I'm good at working autonomously as when I hit issues I've been forced to create solutions from scratch. Examples of this are: getting frustrated with keeping track of knowledge source in med school made me create [wdoc](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/wdoc/), having a new idea on using machine learning for psychiatry let me to create [QuestEA](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/QuestEA), as well as pretty much all my other projects listed down below.
