I'm Olivier Cornelis, a French psychiatry resident and a self-taught developer / data scientist.

To read an informal introduction and what I'm up to, go to [ABOUT](./about).

For my formal CV, check out the [English](./cv_en) or [French](./cv_fr) version.

If interested in hiring me, you should know that I often work for free depending on the cause. I nonetheless own a registered a business entity to allow invoicing if required. See [CONTACT](./contact.md) page.

I maintain a page listing the tools I use during my psychiatry residency: [TOOLS](./tools_en) (or in French: [OUTILS](./tools_fr)).
