I'm Olivier Cornelis, a French psychiatry resident and a self-taught developer / data scientist.

If interested, know that I often work for free depending on the cause, but I'm also a registered business entity with straightforward invoicing. See [CONTACT](./contact.md) page.

To read an informal introduction and what I'm up to, go to [ABOUT](./about).

For my formal CV, check out the [English](./cv_en) or [French](./cv_fr) version.

I maintain a page listing the tools I use during my psychiatry residency: [Tools](./tools) (also available in French: [Outils](./tools_fr)).
