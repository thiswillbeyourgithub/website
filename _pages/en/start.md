I'm Olivier Cornelis, a French psychiatry resident and a self-taught developer / data scientist.

To read an informal introduction and what I'm up to, go to [ABOUT](./about).

My more formal CV can be found on [that page](./cv).

If interested in hiring me, you should know that I often work for free depending on the cause. I nonetheless own a registered a business entity to allow invoicing if required. See [CONTACT](./contact) page.

I try my best to maintain a page listing the tools I use during my psychiatry residency: [TOOLS](./tools).
