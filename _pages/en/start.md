[Ce site existe aussi en français.](../fr/)

I'm Olivier Cornelis, a French psychiatry resident and a self-taught developer / data scientist.

To read an informal introduction and what I'm up to, go to [ABOUT](./about).

A more formal introduction is at [CV](./cv).

A list of my projects is at [PROJECTS](./projects).

I try my best to maintain a page listing the tools I use during my psychiatry residency: [TOOLS](./tools).
