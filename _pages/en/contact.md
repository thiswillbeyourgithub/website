I communicate almost exclusively using [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)) and email.

## By mail
Use "`mail` the @ symbol `oliviercornelis.fr`".

You can download my [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) public key here: [PGP Public Key](../files/PGP_public_key) (fingerprint: `2d865b11d32836fdf346cb4cdd066352a75a462b`).
